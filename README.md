CWEâ„¢ is a community-developed list of software and hardware weakness types. It serves as a common language, a measuring stick for security tools, and a baseline for weakness identification, mitigation, and prevention efforts. Much of this 'database' is IT-based; however, there are both OT-based and ICS-based (industrial control systems) weaknesses that are included.

This release exists in XSD, XML, and JSON formats.

**The current release of the CWE 'database' is v4.12.**
